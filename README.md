# Scope and Requirements #

## This repo provides a series of script for Data-Driven Whole-Genome-Shotgun (WGS) Metagenomics, in particular:

* 1 program allowing the download of a dataset from NCBI.
* 2 programs for speed up the boring procedure of writing in Bash a whole Machine-Learning (ML) meta-analyses based on several WGS datasets (all or part of them, maybe, just downloaded with the above named program).  
* 3 programs producing figures relative to the different aspect of the ML analyses conducted with the above program (the indeed become quite detailed).
* 4 programs devoted to the basic part of a standard WGS analyses, including the generation of figures such as: any type of ordination plot (literally), beta-diversity box-plots, alpha diversity boxplots.
* 5 program plotting the correlation between an index and the distance from the centroid of a class in the data.

### ALL the listed programs can be quite tricky to run if never done before, 'cos a detailed documentaion is still lacking: for any necessity fell free to write at paolomanghi1974@gmail.com.

#### generation of figures relative to the paper: "Metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets identifies cross-cohort microbial diagnostic signatures and a link with choline degradation." ####
